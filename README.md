## Requirements

- Linux
- A WiFi adapter
- `iw` installed

## Installation

You can install Signal Locate using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install signal-locate
```

You can also download precompiled binaries from [Actions](https://github.com/simon0302010/signal-locate/actions/workflows/rust.yml).

## Usage

To use Signal Locate, run the following command:

```bash
sudo signal-locate
```
> Run the precompiled binary if you use that.
> Root privileges are required to scan for WiFi networks.

- After starting, open a room plan of your house (currently, only one floor is supported).
- Select the WiFi network you want to map from the dropdown on the right.
- Walk around your house and click your current position on the map to measure signal strength.
- Collect at least 10 points for a good map.
- When finished, click the **Create Heatmap** button to generate the heatmap.
